# Frontend Design Skill

When developing frontend application, always use this skill to create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality.

## Description
This skill guides the creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. It assists in implementing functional code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Guidelines

### Design Thinking
Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: Identify the problem the interface solves and its target audience.
- **Tone**: Choose a specific aesthetic (e.g., minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist).
- **Constraints**: Consider technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: Aim for an unforgettable and unique design.

**CRITICAL**: Execute a clear conceptual direction with precision. Intentionality is key.

### Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines
Focus on the following areas to ensure high design quality:
- **Typography**: Select unique and interesting fonts; avoid generic choices like Arial or Inter. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Maintain a cohesive aesthetic using CSS variables. Dominant colors with sharp accents are preferred.
- **Motion**: Use animations and micro-interactions for high-impact delight. Prioritize CSS-only solutions or specialized libraries when available.
- **Spatial Composition**: Utilize unexpected layouts, asymmetry, and generous negative space.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth with textures, patterns, and layered transparencies.

**Avoid**: Generic AI-generated aesthetics, overused font families, cliched color schemes (e.g., purple gradients on white), and cookie-cutter layouts.

## Implementation Complexity
Match the implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs require elaborate code with extensive animations, while minimalist designs demand restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing and subtle details.
